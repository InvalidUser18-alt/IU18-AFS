Welcome to my little library of useful things to help you procrastinate at school better!
Right now the library only includes 1 thing, but I plan on extending it further.
If you want you can look in the folder where all the files are and open them individually.
Or you can look at them here and use this to open them just to make it feel like you are hacking.
